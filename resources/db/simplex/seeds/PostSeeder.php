                    Phinx allows developers to alter and manipulate databases in a clear and concise way. It avoids the use of writing
                    SQL by hand and instead offers a powerful API for creating migrations using PHP code. Developers can then version
                    these migrations using their preferred SCM system. This makes Phinx migrations portable between different database
                    systems. Phinx keeps track of which migrations have been run, so you can worry less about the state of your database
                    and instead focus on building better software.',
